Hello Im Kunal Mangalorekar

The keylogger repository contains a keylogger script which runs in the bash shell
This keylogger basically tracks your keystrokes and displays them in the outout.txt file

It is a very simply and basic keylogger since it uses the shell command 'showkey' to track your keystrokes

Thank you for reading!
