The keylogger repository contains a keylogger script which runs in the bash shell
This keylogger basically tracks your keystrokes and displays them in the output.log file

Usage : Open terminal and execute keylogger.sh

The flowchart for execution that takes place is this:
keylogger.sh--> (logger.txt-->myscript.py<--keymaps.txt) -->output.log

NOTE: Only works for Linux and stops after inactivity of 15 seconds.
