The keylogger repository contains a keylogger script which runs in the bash shell
This keylogger basically tracks your keystrokes and displays them in the output.txt file

Usage : Open terminal and execute keylogger.sh

The flowchart for execution that takes place is this:
keylogger.sh--> (logger.txt-->myscript.py<--keymaps.txt) -->output.txt

It is a very simply and basic keylogger since it uses the shell command 'showkey' to track your keystrokes

Thank you for reading!
